# Wiki Elixir

This project provides Elixir connectors to work with Wikipedia (and other
MediaWiki) data sources.  It supports realtime feed processing and (TODO) API calls.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `wiki_elixir` to your list of dependencies in
`mix.exs`, currently only available from GitHub:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:wiki_elixir, github: "adamwight/wiki_elixir"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with `mix docs`.
